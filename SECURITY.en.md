# Security Policy

Korean: [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md)

Thanks for reporting a security issue. For user safety, **please do not disclose vulnerabilities via public issues or pull requests.**

## Reporting a vulnerability

Prefer private disclosure via GitHub Security Advisories:

- Repository **Security** tab → **Advisories** → **Report a vulnerability**

## What to include

- Reproduction steps (minimal if possible)
- Impact (which users/features are affected)
- PoC only when necessary, and remove any sensitive data

## Target SLA

This may vary, but the general targets are:

- **Acknowledgement**: within 7 days
- **Fix/mitigation**: prioritized by severity

## Disclosure

We aim to disclose only after a fix is shipped. Timing is coordinated case-by-case.
